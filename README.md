Code is portable. Tested on Windows 10, Windows 7, OS X 10.11.1 (and a few older versions).

#####Requirements:
* C++ compiler
* GLUT

If I remember correctly, this program visualizes one of sorting methods step-by-step.

#####Usage:
Use `Q` to quit.

Array size can be configured using `Left`/`Right` arrows and `PgUp`/`PgDown`. Random numbers distribution method can be changed using `D` key.

Use `S` to do action, defined by current mode.

There are three modes: *calculate*, *record* and *play*. Use `V` to switch modes.

Array gets sorted immediately in *calculate* mode.

In *record* mode steps are recorded.

In *play* mode those steps are played and playback can be controlled. Kind of =)
